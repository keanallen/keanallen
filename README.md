# 👋 Hey, I'm Kean

Full-stack developer • Startup founder • Code wrangler • Coffee enthusiast ☕  

When I’m not fixing servers at 2AM (because “it works on my machine”), I’m building apps, hosting platforms, and experimenting with new tech.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Build **web apps** (FastAPI, PHP, Laravel, Astro, WordPress, Angular, Vue, React (i hate this a 'lil bit),  you name it 🛠️)  
- Design **mobile apps** (Flutter gang ✌️)  
- Run a **startup** in the Philippines 🇵🇭 (KwikWeb — reliable, like your favorite tricycle driver who never cancels)  
- Occasionally break things… then fix them better 😅

## 😂 A Note About Portfolios
Dear recruiters,  
Yes, I know you ask for GitHub.  
Yes, I know you’re checking if I *actually* code.  
But let’s be real: **portfolios can be faked** (lol).  
What can’t be faked?  
- My late-night commits 🌙  
- My questionable commit messages (“final_final_fix_REALLY_FINAL”)  
- And my love for solving problems with code ❤️

## 🏆 Projects Worth Peeking At
👉 *Pinned repos are my “greatest hits” (a mix of experiments, side projects, and things I swear worked before you cloned them).*
